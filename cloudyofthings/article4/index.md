## Introduction

Before I introduce the Microsoft Azure cloud services for Internet of Things (IoT), I would like to start from Industry 4.0 term.

#### Industry 4.0

Industry 4.0 is a term connected with the Industrial Revolution. Please lets first look at below image. There are four industrial revolutions presented. In this article we are talking about fourth one.

The fourth industrial revolution - term which refers to the concept of the "industrial revolution" in connection with the contemporary mutual use of automation, data processing and exchange as well as manufacturing techniques. Definitionally, it is a collective term for the techniques and principles of the functioning of a value chain organization using or using cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing.
Openness and interoperability between hardware, software, and services will be key in helping manufacturers transform how they operate and create solutions that benefit productivity. It is crucial to provide unified way to communicate between hardware, software and what is more - to communicate with the cloud services.

## Open Platform Configurations Unified Architecture - OPC UA

#### OPC Foundation

OPC Foundation - an organization whose task is to provide broad opportunities for interoperability in the field of automation, by creating and maintaining an open communication standard that allows transfer of process data, alarm and event data, historical data and batch data to devices from different manufacturers.

#### Open Platform Configurations Unified Architecture (OPC UA)

There is a great video created by OPC Foundation which presents the whole idea of OPC UA (Open Platform Configurations Unified Architecture):
