# Face detector - automatic e-mail alerts with Windows IoT Core and Microsoft Azure cloud


![Image](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/Daniel-Krzyczkowski.github.io/blob/master/cloudyofthings/mainassets/CloudyOfThings.png?raw=true)

## Use case

In my previous article (you can find it [here](https://daniel-krzyczkowski.github.io/cloudyofthings/article1/index)) I described how to connect motion sensor to the device with Windows IoT Core system and how to connect it with Microsoft Azure IoT Hub to send SMS alerts once motion is detected.

In this article I would like to extend previous sample with face detection using camera connected to the IoT device and Microsoft Cognitive Serivces (Face API service).

## Solution

In the previous article I presented how to connect motion sensor with Raspberry Pi 2 device running Windows IoT Core system. This time we will add one more element - camera device. Once motion is detected by sensor - photo is taken and analyzied with Microsoft Cognotive Services Face API.

## Code and Configuration

In this section you will find how to create solution described above.

### Face Detector UWP application for Windows IoT Core

### Microsoft Azure services configuration

In this section you will find which services were used in the Azure cloud and how to configure them. I assume that you have active Azure subscription.

### Azure IoT Hub
