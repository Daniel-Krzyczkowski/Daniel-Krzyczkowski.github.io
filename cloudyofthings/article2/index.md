# Face detector - automatic e-mail alerts with Windows IoT Core and Microsoft Azure cloud

## Use case

In my previous article (you can find it [here](https://daniel-krzyczkowski.github.io/cloudyofthings/article1/index)) I described how to connect motion sensor to the device with Windows IoT Core system and how to connect it with Microsoft Azure IoT Hub to send SMS alerts once motion is detected.

In this article I would like to extend previous sample with face detection using camera device and Microsoft Cognitive Serivces (Face API service).
