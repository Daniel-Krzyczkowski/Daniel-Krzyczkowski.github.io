# Introduction

I have decided to create series related to identity and access management using Azure cloud services. Important note first - I will focus more on the development side and integration aspects. This series is focused on developers who would like to understand different concepts and mechanisms around identity using Azure cloud services like Azure Active Directory and Azure Active Directory B2C.

In the second article from the series we are going to talk about Azure Active Directory and Azure Activer Directory B2C services.

**Important**

This series assumes that you already have some basic knowledge around identity concepts, application implementation, and Azure cloud services - at least Azure Active Directory.
