# Introduction

DevOps practices are crucial when building and maintaining cloud solutions. DevOps provides many different benefits like:

- Faster, better features delivery
- Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity
- More stable operating environments
- Greater automation
- Greater visibility into system outcomes

However many times we forget about security in this whole "DevOps loop" which is also very important. This is why it is beneficial to extend DevOps approach with security practices to end up with Secure DevOps, or DevSecOps. Before we jump into practices, technical details, and many other things, it is good to explain what DevSecOps is.


# Explanation of DevSecOps

DevSecOps applies innovation security by integrating security processes and tools into the DevOps development process.
As many organizations prepares to adopt DevOps practices, it is crucial to adapt security and other governance processes to our planned approach. This approach mitigates security risk but doesn't decrease the value of rapid release cycles.

Integrating security late in the process is expensive and hard to fix. This is why we should *Shift security left* in the timeline to integrate it into the envisioning, design, implementation, and operation phases of DevOps cycle.

Many organizations look to software development to gain a competitive advantage through innovation.
Protecting this innovation requires that organizations address potential security weaknesses and attacks in both the development process and the infrastructure hosting the applications. This approach is related to both worlds: cloud and on-premises.

Attackers might exploit weaknesses in development process (attackers might find weakness in the implementation of the design, for example, code doesn't validate input and allows common attacks like SQL injection) but also in the IT infrastructure (attackers might also conduct a multistage attack that uses stolen credentials or malware to access development infrastructure from other parts of the environment).

To summarize, when we talk about DevSecOps, these three parts shoul be kept in mind:

1. Dev - Application development aligned with business and user needs, which are often rapidly evolving.
2. Sec - Application must be resilient to attacks from rapidly evolving attackers and take advantage of innovations in security defenses
3. Ops - Application must be reliable and perform efficiently
