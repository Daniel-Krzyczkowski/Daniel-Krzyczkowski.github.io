# Introduction

It is an interesting time when it comes to source code security. In the era of open-source projects, it is very important to focus not only on the code quality but also on the security. There are a lot of different libraries available on GitHub, that are helpful and free. As developers, we have to remember that code quality is crucial but security verification should be mandatory. Avoid storing credentials in the source code or keeping all libraries up-to-date can be challenging. This is the place where GitHub CodeQL scanning can help.
