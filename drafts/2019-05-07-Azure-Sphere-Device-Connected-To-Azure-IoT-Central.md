**TL;DR** 

Some time ago I jumped into Internet of Things topics connected with Microsoft Azure cloud. As a result I created my own series of articles about Azure IoT called **Cloudy of Things**.

You can read them all on this blog.

In this article you can find my latest project in which I connected Azure Sphere IoT device to the Azure IoT Central service to display data from sensors and take up some actions.

[Source code for this project is available here](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/WindowsIoT-AzureIoT/tree/master/AzureIoT/AzureSphereProject/SRC)
