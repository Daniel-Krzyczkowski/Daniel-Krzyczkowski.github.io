# Introduction

Azure AD B2C identity service enables issuing access tokens on behalf of the authenticated user. In scenarios where we want to access specific resources like APIs, we can sign in and obtain an access token in the context of a specific user. What about scenarios where we would like to still use Azure AD B2C as an identity service but we would like to use client credentials flow to enable secure communication between two applications without the context of the authenticated user? In this article, we will see how to implement client credentials flow to obtain an access token in the Azure Function App to securely call ASP .NET Core Web API endpoint with this token.

To demonstrate how to implement the above scenario, we are going to use two applications:
* **Azure Function App** - this one will obtain an access token from the Azure AD B2C using client credentials flow
* **ASP .NET Core Web API** - this one will be secured by Azure AD B2C and provide access to endpoint only for the requests with access tokens added in the authorization header

</p>


**IMPORTANT**

In the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/application-types#daemonsserver-side-applications) of the Azure AD B2C identity service, we can find information that *The OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow is not currently directly supported by the Azure AD B2C authentication service*. It is true but we can still obtain access tokens with client credentials flow using Azure Active Directory and the Microsoft identity platform /token (https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/v2.0/token) endpoint for an application in our Azure AD B2C tenant. An Azure AD B2C tenant shares some functionality with Azure AD enterprise tenants. To sum up - we can still obtain access tokens using client credentials flow to securely communicate between the applications we registered in the Azure AD B2C tenant without the context of the user.


# Application registrations in the Azure AD B2C

First of all, we have to register the two applications I mentioned above:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow2.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

## ASP .NET Core Web API registration

First, we will register an API application which will be called from the Azure Function App. Once the application is registered, we have to note these two parameters:
* Client ID
* Tenant ID

We will use the above parameters in the application's configuration.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow3.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Then, we have to expose our API so we can obtain access tokens to access it. Under *Expose an API* section we have to click *+Add scope* button:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow4.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Then we have to click *Save and continue* button:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow5.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

On the next blade that will be displayed, we can click *X* icon to close the tab - yes, we do not want to add any additional scopes. At the top, there will be *Application ID URI* displayed. We have to copy it because we will need it later when we will configure Azure Function App.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow6.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>


Now we have to add an application role in the Manifest file. We want to include the role in the access token so our API will not only validate the access token issued by Azure AD B2C but also it will verify if a specific role is included in the access token. To modify manifest, we have to select *Manifest* section:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow7.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

We have to find *appRoles* property. It is empty by default. We will add *access:test-api* role to it. We have to replace the existing property with the below value:

 ```json
    "appRoles": [
        {
            "allowedMemberTypes": [
                "Application"
            ],
            "description": "All API read-only access",
            "displayName": "All API read-only",
            "id": "bc3b46b8-22ab-4868-8136-573a1a38233a",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "lang": null,
            "origin": "Application",
            "value": "access:test-api"
        }
    ],
```

You can ask how ID value was generated - it has to be GUID that you can generate with any online GUID generator. The ID property should be unique for each role we add in the manifest. Great, once we add the above role, we have to save changes.


## Azure Function App registration

Once the application is registered, we have to note these two parameters:
* Client ID
* Tenant ID

We will use the above parameters in the application's configuration.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow8.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Then, we have to grant permission for Azure Function App to obtain access tokens to call ASP .NET Core Web API application. To do it, we have to select *API permissions* tab, and then click *+Add permission*:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow9.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Then, we have to switch to *My APIs* tab, and find the API application we registered above:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow11.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Next, we have to select *Application permissions*, and select the checkbox next to the *access:test-api* permission:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow10.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

In the end we have to grant admin consent:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow12.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Now we have to do is secret generation. We will need an app secret to call token endpoint using client credentials flow. We can generate app secret for our Function App under *Certificates & secrets* section using *New client secret* button. We will need the value of the secret in the app configuration later in this article.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow13.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

The last thing we have to set it to redirect URL. Under *Authentication* tab, we have to add a web platform, and indicate the URL of our Azure Function App running on the localhost in this case:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow14.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>


Great, now we can dive into the source code and configuration.



# Obtain access tokens using client credentials flow in the Azure Function App

Source code of the Azure Function App I used in this article is available on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/tree/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.FuncApp). To obtain access tokens using client credentials flow I used [*Microsoft.Identity.Client*](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Identity.Client/) library provided by Microsoft.

## Function App configuration

First, we have to prepare settings of the Azure Function App to be able to call token endpoint and obtain access tokens. Here is the *AzureAdB2C* section from the [*local.settings.json*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.FuncApp/local.settings.json) file:


 ```json
  "AzureAdB2C": {
    "Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<<TENANT-ID>>/oauth2/v2.0",
    "ClientId": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "RedirectUri": "http://localhost:7071",
    "Scope": "https://techmindfactoryidentity.onmicrosoft.com/<<API-APP-CLIENT-ID>>/.default"
  }
```

Let's discuss above parameters:

* Authority - this parameter indicates which authorization server issued the token, it is validated when the request is sent to the API with the access token included in the HTTP authorization header. Under *TENANT-ID* we should place tenant ID we copied from the Azure portal
* ClientId - ID of the registered Azure Function App in the Azure AD B2C tenant
* ClientSecret - Secret value we generated for the registered Azure Function App in the Azure AD B2C tenant
* RedirectUri - URL where access token should be returned
* Scope - this parameter indicates that we want to obtain access token to call ASP .NET Core Web API. Under *API-APP-CLIENT-ID* we should place Client ID of the registered Web API application in the Azure AD B2C tenant

## Function App source code implementation

Now in the [*Program.cs*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.FuncApp/Program.cs) file we need to register few dependencies. To do it I created a dedicated method called *RegisterDependencies* that will be called in the [*ConfigureServices*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.FuncApp/Program.cs#L15) method:

 ```csharp
        private static void RegisterDependencies(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
               .SetBasePath(Environment.CurrentDirectory)
               .AddJsonFile("local.settings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
               .AddEnvironmentVariables()
               .Build();

            services.Configure<AzureAdB2cSettings>(config.GetSection("AzureAdB2C"));

            services.AddScoped(implementationFactory =>
            {
                var confidentialClient = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(config["AzureAdB2C:ClientId"])
                    .WithClientSecret(config["AzureAdB2C:ClientSecret"])
                    .WithAuthority(config["AzureAdB2C:Authority"])
                    .WithRedirectUri(config["AzureAdB2C:RedirectUri"])
                    .Build();

                return confidentialClient;
            });

            services.AddHttpClient();
        }
```

In the above code fragment, we can see that *ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder* class is used. It is provided in the *Microsoft.Identity.Client* NuGet library which we use in this project. We have to provide all the parameters we discussed above. Please note that we also have to register *HttpClient* to make HTTP calls to Web API application. There is also *AzureAdB2cSettings* class used to keep information about the scope. We will use it when making a call to obtain an access token.

Now in the [*TestFunction*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.FuncApp/TestFunction.cs) class we have to implement source code responsible for obtaining new access tokens. We use *IConfidentialClientApplication* instance with *AcquireTokenForClient* method to call Azure AD token to obtain the access token:

 ```csharp
            AuthenticationResult result = await _confidentialClient
                                               .AcquireTokenForClient(new string[] { _azureAdB2cSettings.Scope })
                                               .ExecuteAsync();
```
As we can see, the scope is also passed to the request. It is required because we want to obtain access token with the *access:test-api* permission included in the *roles* claim inside an access token.

Once we obtain access token, we have to place it in the authorization header before the request to the API is sent:

 ```csharp
var accessToken = result.AccessToken;

            _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken);
            var testDataEndpointResponse = await _httpClient.GetAsync("http://localhost:5000/testdata");
```

The rest of the code is responsible for the verification of the HTTP status code returned from the API.

If we look inside the content of the access token, we can see that *roles* claim is included:

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/devisland/article78/assets/AdB2cClientCredentialsFlow15.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image not found"/>
</p>

Now it is time to see how access tokens are validated in the ASP .NET Core Web API project.


# Validate access tokens issued using client credentials flow in the ASP .NET Core Web API

Source code of the ASP .NET Core Web API application I used in this article is available on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/tree/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.API).


## ASP .NET Core Web API configuration

First we have to prepare settings of Web API application to be able to validate access tokens. Here is the *AzureAdB2C* section from the [*appsettings.json*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.API/appsettings.json) file:


 ```json
  "AzureAdB2C": {
    "ClientId": "",
    "Domain": "xxx.onmicrosoft.com",
    "MetadataAddress": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<<TENANT-ID>>/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "Authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<<TENANT-ID>>/v2.0"
  }
```

Let's discuss above parameters:

* Authority - this parameter indicates which authorization server issued the token, it is validated when the request is sent to the API with the access token included in the HTTP authorization header. Under *TENANT-ID* we should place tenant ID we copied from the Azure portal
* ClientId - ID of the registered Web API application in the Azure AD B2C tenant
* MetadataAddress - Url address under which API can obtain OpenID configuration and get signing keys used to sign access tokens


## ASP .NET Core Web API source code implementation

We need to implement source code that will be responsible for validating access tokens including verification of the role included in the token. In the [Startup.cs](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/master/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.API/Startup.cs) file in the *ConfigureServices* method we have to add below lines of code:


 ```csharp
            services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                    .AddJwtBearer("ClientCredentialsScheme", jwtOptions =>
                     {
                         jwtOptions.MetadataAddress = Configuration["AzureAdB2C:MetadataAddress"];
                         jwtOptions.Authority = Configuration["AzureAdB2C:Authority"];
                         jwtOptions.Audience = Configuration["AzureAdB2C:ClientId"];
                     });

            services.AddAuthorization(options =>
            {
                var authorizationPolicy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
                                              .RequireRole("access:test-api")
                                              .AddAuthenticationSchemes("ClientCredentialsScheme")
                                              .Build();
                options.AddPolicy("OnlyAuthorizedAccess", authorizationPolicy);
            });
```

Let's describe the above fragment. With *AddAuthentication* we want to add handling JWT access tokens to verify if these tokens were issued by the proper authority (in this case Azure AD B2C tenant). As we can see we have to provide the parameters we described above. If you want to read more about authentication concepts in the ASP .NET Core, I encourage you to check [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/?view=aspnetcore-5.0).

Then, we want to also verify if the access token contains *access:test-api* role. This is why we have to use *AddAuthorization* method. Please note that we require *access:test-api* role and we define *OnlyAuthorizedAccess* which will be used in the controller class. With this approach, we validate access tokens sent to the API endpoints but also we check if these tokens contain a specific role.

In the [*Configure*](https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/IdentityDeveloperTemplates/blob/b5ab23e506d8040b4672bab09a16844a73f1fce6/src/app-templates/IdentityDeveloperTemplates.ClientCredentialsAdB2C.API/Startup.cs#L49) method we have to also add below two lines:

 ```csharp
            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();
```

Now let's see how to secure API controller with the policy we created above:

 ```csharp
    [Authorize(Policy = "OnlyAuthorizedAccess")]
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class TestDataController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger<TestDataController> _logger;

        public TestDataController(ILogger<TestDataController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Get()
        {
            return Ok("Operation authorized");
        }
    }
```

From this point, if we try to call *Get* method without the access token, API will return 403 status code forbidden. If we try to use the access token without the *access:test-api* role, the result will be the same.

</p>


# Summary

In this article, we discussed how to restrict anonymous access to ASP .NET Core Web API controller methods. We saw how to obtain an access token using client credentials flow. This approach can be helpful in scenarios where user context is not presented and we would like to still secure access to our API using access tokens.
